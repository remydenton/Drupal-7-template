CLEAN
=====

DESCRIPTION

The idea behind this theme was to make a clean, versatile base theme to help
speed up your workflow and is possibly the fastest route to creating your own
custom theme.

USAGE

When working with Clean theme it is important not to hack the "core" files
(just like working with Drupal core itself). The recommended method for using
this theme is to create a subtheme using Clean as your base theme in the info
file. Using this technique will ensure you can benefit from future changes to
Clean theme.

If you need to override any of the included CSS files simply redeclare CSS
files in your subtheme using the same name as the file you wish to override.

AUTHORS

Clean theme was created and is maintained by Richard Burford aka psynaptic from
